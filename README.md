# Tic-tac-toe
A simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game developed by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a winning line. The game features an interactive interface, instant win detection, and a smooth user experience with responsive design and clean visuals.
